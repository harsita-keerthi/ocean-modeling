# Upwelling during Indian Ocean Dipole

## Experiment Description

In this project, I will investigate the difference in Indian Ocean Dipoles between a positive and negative year. In particular, I will investigate the following science question:

_How does the Indian Ocean Dipole affect the surrounding waters during positive and negative years?_

This model experiment investigates the impact of the **Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD)** on sea surface temperature by comparing two years: **1997**, a strong positive IOD year, and **1996**, a neutral year. The region of interest spans the equatorial and western Indian Ocean, including the Arabian Sea, Bay of Bengal, and waters near Indonesia. Using ECCO Version 5 model data, I will simulate SST patterns and ocean stratification for both years. The experiment will analyze temperature anomalies, vertical temperature profiles, and spatial SST distributions. I anticipate that 1997 will show significant cooling in the western Indian Ocean due to strong upwelling, while the eastern Indian Ocean will experience warming as upwelling weakens and the thermocline deepens. In contrast, 1996 should exhibit more stable SST patterns with weaker temperature gradients. By comparing these two years, this study will highlight the IODâ€™s role in modulating ocean temperatures and circulation patterns in the Indian Ocean basin.
